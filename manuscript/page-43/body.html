<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There are able-bodied men here who work from early morning until late at night, in ice-cold cellars with a quarter of an inch of water on the floor&mdash;men who for six or seven months in the year never see the sunlight from Sunday afternoon till the next Sunday morning&mdash;and who cannot earn three hundred dollars in a year. There are little children here, scarce in their teens, who can hardly see the top of the work benches&mdash;whose parents have lied to get them their places&mdash;and who do not make the half of three hundred dollars a year, and perhaps not even the third of it. And then to spend such a sum, all in a single day of your life, at a wedding feast! (For obviously it is the same thing, whether you spend it at once for your own wedding, or in a long time, at the weddings of all your friends.)</p></div> </div>
