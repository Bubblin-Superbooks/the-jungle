<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jurgis did not get out of the Bridewell quite as soon as he had expected. To his sentence there were added &ldquo;court costs&rdquo; of a dollar and a half&mdash;he was supposed to pay for the trouble of putting him in jail, and not having the money, was obliged to work it off by three days more of toil. Nobody had taken the trouble to tell him this&mdash;only after counting the days and looking forward to the end in an agony of impatience, when the hour came that he expected to be free he found himself still set at the stone heap, and laughed at when he ventured to protest. Then he concluded he must have counted wrong; but as another day passed, he gave up all hope&mdash;and was sunk in the depths of despair, when one morning after breakfast a keeper came to him with the word that his time was up at last.</p></div> </div>
