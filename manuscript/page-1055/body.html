The &ldquo;pitchfork senator&rdquo; stood their fusillade of questions for about an hour, and then went home in disgust, and the balance of the meeting was a strictly party affair.

The senator had been denying that the Democratic party was corrupt; it was always the Republicans who bought the votes, he said&mdash;and here was Jurgis shouting furiously, &ldquo;It's a lie! It's a lie!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
