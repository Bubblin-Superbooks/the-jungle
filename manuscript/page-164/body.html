The lawyer read over the deed, and when he had read it he informed Szedvilas that it was all perfectly regular, that the deed was a blank deed such as was often used in these sales.

Yes, that was correct. And it was for the sale of such and such a house&mdash;the house and lot and everything? Yes,&mdash;and the lawyer showed him where that was all written. And it was all perfectly regular&mdash;there were no tricks about it of any sort?
