<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In still other places men were engaged in cutting up the carcasses that had been through the chilling rooms. First there were the &ldquo;splitters,&rdquo; the most expert workmen in the plant, who earned as high as fifty cents an hour, and did not a thing all day except chop hogs down the middle. Then there were &ldquo;cleaver men,&rdquo; great giants with muscles of iron; each had two men to attend him&mdash;to slide the half carcass in front of him on the table, and hold it while he chopped it, and then turn each piece so that he might chop it once more. His cleaver had a blade about two feet long, and he never made but one cut; he made it so neatly, too, that his implement did not smite through and dull itself&mdash;there was just enough force for a perfect cut, and no more.</p></div> </div>
