<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A man he had met, his cell mate had replied&mdash;one thing leads to another. Didn't he ever wonder about his family, Jurgis asked. Sometimes, the other answered, but not often&mdash;he didn't allow it. Thinking about it would make it no better. This wasn't a world in which a man had any business with a family; sooner or later Jurgis would find that out also, and give up the fight and shift for himself.</p><p>Jurgis was so transparently what he pretended to be that his cell mate was as open with him as a child; it was pleasant to tell him adventures, he was so full of wonder and admiration, he was so new to the ways of the country. Duane did not even bother to keep back names and places&mdash;he told all his triumphs and his failures, his loves and his griefs.</p></div> </div>
