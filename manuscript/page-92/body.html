<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number of the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it was only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that there was no school, but that these were the children of the neighborhood&mdash;that there were so many children to the block in Packingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move faster than a walk!</p><p>It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the streets. Those through which Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled streets less than they did a miniature topographical map. The roadway was commonly several feet lower than the level of the houses, which were sometimes joined by high board walks; there were no pavements&mdash;there were mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and ditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water.</p></div> </div>
