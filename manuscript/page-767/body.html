An' how's the twins, Hamilton?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are doing well, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Master Freddie; and added fervently: &ldquo;God bless 'em, the little lambs!&rdquo;</p><p>They went up the great staircase, one step at a time; at the top of it there gleamed at them out of the shadows the figure of a nymph crouching by a fountain, a figure ravishingly beautiful, the flesh warm and glowing with the hues of life. Above was a huge court, with domed roof, the various apartments opening into it. The butler had paused below but a few minutes to give orders, and then followed them; now he pressed a button, and the hall blazed with light. He opened a door before them, and then pressed another button, as they staggered into the apartment.</p></div> </div>
