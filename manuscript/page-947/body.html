What else could I do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don't you save any money?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Save!&rdquo; said Marija. &ldquo;Good Lord, no! I get enough, I suppose, but it all goes. I get a half share, two dollars and a half for each customer, and sometimes I make twenty-five or thirty dollars a night, and you'd think I ought to save something out of that! But then I am charged for my room and my meals&mdash;and such prices as you never heard of; and then for extras, and drinks&mdash;for everything I get, and some I don't. My laundry bill is nearly twenty dollars each week alone&mdash;think of that! Yet what can I do? I either have to stand it or quit, and it would be the same anywhere else.</p></div> </div>
