Thousands of them came to Chicago answering advertisements for &ldquo;servants&rdquo; and &ldquo;factory hands,&rdquo; and found themselves trapped by fake employment agencies, and locked up in a bawdy-house. It was generally enough to take all their clothes away from them; but sometimes they would have to be &ldquo;doped&rdquo; and kept prisoners for weeks; and meantime their parents might be telegraphing the police, and even coming on to see why nothing was done. Occasionally there was no way of satisfying them but to let them search the place to which the girl had been traced.</p></div> </div>
