<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The children would come to the yards with great shawls about their ears, and so tied up that you could hardly find them&mdash;and still there would be accidents. One bitter morning in February the little boy who worked at the lard machine with Stanislovas came about an hour late, and screaming with pain. They unwrapped him, and a man began vigorously rubbing his ears; and as they were frozen stiff, it took only two or three rubs to break them short off. As a result of this, little Stanislovas conceived a terror of the cold that was almost a mania. Every morning, when it came time to start for the yards, he would begin to cry and protest. Nobody knew quite how to manage him, for threats did no good&mdash;it seemed to be something that he could not control, and they feared sometimes that he would go into convulsions.</p></div> </div>
