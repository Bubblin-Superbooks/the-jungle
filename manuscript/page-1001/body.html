He would have asked Jurgis to his home&mdash;but he had only two rooms, and had no bed to offer. He would have given up his own bed, but his wife was ill. Later on, when he understood that otherwise Jurgis would have to sleep in a hallway, he offered him his kitchen floor, a chance which the other was only too glad to accept. &ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow we can do better,&rdquo; said Ostrinski. &ldquo;We try not to let a comrade starve.&rdquo;</p><p>Ostrinski's home was in the Ghetto district, where he had two rooms in the basement of a tenement.
