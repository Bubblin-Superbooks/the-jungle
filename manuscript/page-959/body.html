What were they expecting to get out of it anyhow&mdash;what had they to do with elections, with governing the country? Jurgis had been behind the scenes in politics.</p><p>He went back to his thoughts, but with one further fact to reckon with&mdash;that he was caught here. The hall was now filled to the doors; and after the meeting it would be too late for him to go home, so he would have to make the best of it outside. Perhaps it would be better to go home in the morning, anyway, for the children would be at school, and he and Elzbieta could have a quiet explanation. She always had been a reasonable person; and he really did mean to do right. He would manage to persuade her of it&mdash;and besides, Marija was willing, and Marija was furnishing the money. If Elzbieta were ugly, he would tell her that in so many words.</p></div> </div>
