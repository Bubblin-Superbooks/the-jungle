<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There is no wilderness where I can hide from these things, there is no haven where I can escape them; though I travel to the ends of the earth, I find the same accursed system&mdash;I find that all the fair and noble impulses of humanity, the dreams of poets and the agonies of martyrs, are shackled and bound in the service of organized and predatory Greed! And therefore I cannot rest, I cannot be silent; therefore I cast aside comfort and happiness, health and good repute&mdash;and go out into the world and cry out the pain of my spirit! Therefore I am not to be silenced by poverty and sickness, not by hatred and obloquy, by threats and ridicule&mdash;not by prison and persecution, if they should come&mdash;not by any power that is upon the earth or above the earth, that was, or is, or ever can be created.</p></div> </div>
