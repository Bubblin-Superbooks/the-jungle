<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jurgis had often wondered just who ate the canned corned beef and &ldquo;roast beef&rdquo; of the stockyards; now he began to understand&mdash;that it was what you might call &ldquo;graft meat,&rdquo; put up to be sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by soldiers and sailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions, &ldquo;shantymen&rdquo; and gangs of railroad laborers.</p><p>Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks. This did not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to work, but simply that he could get along without further attention, and that his place was needed for some one worse off than he. That he was utterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the meantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities, nor any one else in the city.</p></div> </div>
