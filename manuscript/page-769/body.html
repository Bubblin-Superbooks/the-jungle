He yawned, opening a mouth like a dragon's; and he came toward the young man, wagging his tail. &ldquo;Hello, Dewey!&rdquo; cried his master. &ldquo;Been havin' a snooze, ole boy? Well, well&mdash;hello there, whuzzamatter?&rdquo; (The dog was snarling at Jurgis.) &ldquo;Why, Dewey&mdash;this' my fren', Mr. Rednose&mdash;ole fren' the guv'ner's! Mr. Rednose, Admiral Dewey; shake han's&mdash;hic. Ain't he a daisy, though&mdash;blue ribbon at the New York show&mdash;eighty-five hundred at a clip! How's that, hey?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
