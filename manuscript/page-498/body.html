<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Pat&rdquo; Callahan&mdash;&ldquo;Growler&rdquo; Pat, as he had been known before he ascended the bench&mdash;had begun life as a butcher boy and a bruiser of local reputation; he had gone into politics almost as soon as he had learned to talk, and had held two offices at once before he was old enough to vote. If Scully was the thumb, Pat Callahan was the first finger of the unseen hand whereby the packers held down the people of the district. No politician in Chicago ranked higher in their confidence; he had been at it a long time&mdash;had been the business agent in the city council of old Durham, the self-made merchant, way back in the early days, when the whole city of Chicago had been up at auction. &ldquo;Growler&rdquo; Pat had given up holding city offices very early in his career&mdash;caring only for party power, and giving the rest of his time to superintending his dives and brothels.</p></div> </div>
