<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate? What is the labor cost of a book?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously it is the labor cost of the paper, printing, and binding of it&mdash;about a fifth of its present cost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the author?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have already said that the state could not control intellectual production. The state might say that it had taken a year to write the book, and the author might say it had taken thirty. Goethe said that every bon mot of his had cost a purse of gold. What I outline here is a national, or rather international, system for the providing of the material needs of men. Since a man has intellectual needs also, he will work longer, earn more, and provide for them to his own taste and in his own way.</p></div> </div>
