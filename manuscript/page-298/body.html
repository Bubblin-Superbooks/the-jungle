It gave them pleasure to believe this, for Scully stood as the people's man, and boasted of it boldly when election day came. The packers had wanted a bridge at Ashland Avenue, but they had not been able to get it till they had seen Scully; and it was the same with &ldquo;Bubbly Creek,&rdquo; which the city had threatened to make the packers cover over, till Scully had come to their aid. &ldquo;Bubbly Creek&rdquo; is an arm of the Chicago River, and forms the southern boundary of the yards: all the drainage of the square mile of packing houses empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer a hundred or two feet wide. One long arm of it is blind, and the filth stays there forever and a day.</p></div> </div>
