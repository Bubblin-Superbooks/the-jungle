With the voice of all your wrongs, with the voice of all your desires; with the voice of your duty and your hope&mdash;of everything in the world that is worth while to you! The voice of the poor, demanding that poverty shall cease! The voice of the oppressed, pronouncing the doom of oppression! The voice of power, wrought out of suffering&mdash;of resolution, crushed out of weakness&mdash;of joy and courage, born in the bottomless pit of anguish and despair! The voice of Labor, despised and outraged; a mighty giant, lying prostrate&mdash;mountainous, colossal, but blinded, bound, and ignorant of his strength. And now a dream of resistance haunts him, hope battling with fear; until suddenly he stirs, and a fetter snaps&mdash;</p></div> </div>
