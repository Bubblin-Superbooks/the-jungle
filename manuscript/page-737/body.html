<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Poor Jurgis might have been expected to make a successful beggar. He was just out of the hospital, and desperately sick-looking, and with a helpless arm; also he had no overcoat, and shivered pitifully. But, alas, it was again the case of the honest merchant, who finds that the genuine and unadulterated article is driven to the wall by the artistic counterfeit. Jurgis, as a beggar, was simply a blundering amateur in competition with organized and scientific professionalism. He was just out of the hospital&mdash;but the story was worn threadbare, and how could he prove it? He had his arm in a sling&mdash;and it was a device a regular beggar's little boy would have scorned. He was pale and shivering&mdash;but they were made up with cosmetics, and had studied the art of chattering their teeth.</p></div> </div>
