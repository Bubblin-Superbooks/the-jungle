He was introduced by his friend to an Irishman named &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; Halloran, who was a political &ldquo;worker&rdquo; and on the inside of things. This man talked with Jurgis for a while, and then told him that he had a little plan by which a man who looked like a workingman might make some easy money; but it was a private affair, and had to be kept quiet.</p></div> </div>
