<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That was the competitive wage system; and if Jurgis wanted to understand what Socialism was, it was there he had best begin. The workers were dependent upon a job to exist from day to day, and so they bid against each other, and no man could get more than the lowest man would consent to work for. And thus the mass of the people were always in a life-and-death struggle with poverty. That was &ldquo;competition,&rdquo; so far as it concerned the wage-earner, the man who had only his labor to sell; to those on top, the exploiters, it appeared very differently, of course&mdash;there were few of them, and they could combine and dominate, and their power would be unbreakable. And so all over the world two classes were forming, with an unbridged chasm between them&mdash;the capitalist class, with its enormous fortunes, and the proletariat, bound into slavery by unseen chains.</p></div> </div>
