<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For her canning factory shut down! Marija would about as soon have expected to see the sun shut down&mdash;the huge establishment had been to her a thing akin to the planets and the seasons. But now it was shut! And they had not given her any explanation, they had not even given her a day's warning; they had simply posted a notice one Saturday that all hands would be paid off that afternoon, and would not resume work for at least a month! And that was all that there was to it&mdash;her job was gone!</p><p>It was the holiday rush that was over, the girls said in answer to Marija's inquiries; after that there was always a slack. Sometimes the factory would start up on half time after a while, but there was no telling&mdash;it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer.</p></div> </div>
