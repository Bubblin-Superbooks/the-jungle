<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The evangelist was preaching &ldquo;sin and redemption,&rdquo; the infinite grace of God and His pardon for human frailty. He was very much in earnest, and he meant well, but Jurgis, as he listened, found his soul filled with hatred. What did he know about sin and suffering&mdash;with his smooth, black coat and his neatly starched collar, his body warm, and his belly full, and money in his pocket&mdash;and lecturing men who were struggling for their lives, men at the death grapple with the demon powers of hunger and cold!&mdash;This, of course, was unfair; but Jurgis felt that these men were out of touch with the life they discussed, that they were unfitted to solve its problems; nay, they themselves were part of the problem&mdash;they were part of the order established that was crushing men down and beating them! They were of the triumphant and insolent possessors;</p></div> </div>
