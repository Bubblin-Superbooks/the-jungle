<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In a week Jurgis got over his sense of helplessness and bewilderment in the rail mill. He learned to find his way about and to take all the miracles and terrors for granted, to work without hearing the rumbling and crashing. From blind fear he went to the other extreme; he became reckless and indifferent, like all the rest of the men, who took but little thought of themselves in the ardor of their work. It was wonderful, when one came to think of it, that these men should have taken an interest in the work they did&mdash;they had no share in it&mdash;they were paid by the hour, and paid no more for being interested. Also they knew that if they were hurt they would be flung aside and forgotten&mdash;and still they would hurry to their task by dangerous short cuts, would use methods that were quicker and more effective in spite of the fact that they were also risky.</p></div> </div>
