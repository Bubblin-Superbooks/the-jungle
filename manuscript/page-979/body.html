<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They live in palaces, they riot in luxury and extravagance&mdash;such as no words can describe, as makes the imagination reel and stagger, makes the soul grow sick and faint. They spend hundreds of dollars for a pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a garter; they spend millions for horses and automobiles and yachts, for palaces and banquets, for little shiny stones with which to deck their bodies. Their life is a contest among themselves for supremacy in ostentation and recklessness, in the destroying of useful and necessary things, in the wasting of the labor and the lives of their fellow creatures, the toil and anguish of the nations, the sweat and tears and blood of the human race! It is all theirs&mdash;it comes to them; just as all the springs pour into streamlets, and the streamlets into rivers, and the rivers into the oceans&mdash;so, automatically and inevitably, all the wealth of society comes to them.</p></div> </div>
