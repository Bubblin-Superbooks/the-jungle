<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Who will carry the good tidings to others, as I have carried them to him&mdash;priceless gift of liberty and light that is neither mine nor his, but is the heritage of the soul of man! Working-men, working-men&mdash;comrades! open your eyes and look about you! You have lived so long in the toil and heat that your senses are dulled, your souls are numbed; but realize once in your lives this world in which you dwell&mdash;tear off the rags of its customs and conventions&mdash;behold it as it is, in all its hideous nakedness! Realize it, realize it! Realize that out upon the plains of Manchuria tonight two hostile armies are facing each other&mdash;that now, while we are seated here, a million human beings may be hurled at each other's throats, striving with the fury of maniacs to tear each other to pieces! And this in the twentieth century, nineteen hundred years since the Prince of Peace was born on earth!</p></div> </div>
