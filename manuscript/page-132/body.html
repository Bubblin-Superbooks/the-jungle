<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If you counted with it the other big plants&mdash;and they were now really all one&mdash;it was, so Jokubas informed them, the greatest aggregation of labor and capital ever gathered in one place. It employed thirty thousand men; it supported directly two hundred and fifty thousand people in its neighborhood, and indirectly it supported half a million. It sent its products to every country in the civilized world, and it furnished the food for no less than thirty million people!</p><p>To all of these things our friends would listen open-mouthed&mdash;it seemed to them impossible of belief that anything so stupendous could have been devised by mortal man. That was why to Jurgis it seemed almost profanity to speak about the place as did Jokubas, skeptically; it was a thing as tremendous as the universe&mdash;the laws and ways of its working no more than the universe to be questioned or understood.</p></div> </div>
