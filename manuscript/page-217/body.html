<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nobody could tell why that was; there must be something about the house, or the way it was built&mdash;some folks said it was because the building had been begun in the dark of the moon. There were dozens of houses that way in Packingtown. Sometimes there would be a particular room that you could point out&mdash;if anybody slept in that room he was just as good as dead. With this house it had been the Irish first; and then a Bohemian family had lost a child of it&mdash;though, to be sure, that was uncertain, since it was hard to tell what was the matter with children who worked in the yards. In those days there had been no law about the age of children&mdash;the packers had worked all but the babies. At this remark the family looked puzzled, and Grandmother Majauszkiene again had to make an explanation&mdash;that it was against the law for children to work before they were sixteen.</p></div> </div>
