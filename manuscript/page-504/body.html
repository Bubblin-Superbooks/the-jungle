There was a breaking of floodgates, a whirl of new memories and new griefs rushing into his mind. In far Lithuania they had celebrated Christmas; and it came to him as if it had been yesterday&mdash;himself a little child, with his lost brother and his dead father in the cabin&mdash;in the deep black forest, where the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the world.

And even in Packingtown they had not forgotten it&mdash;some gleam of it had never failed to break their darkness.</p></div> </div>
