Each one of the occupants furnished his own accommodations&mdash;that is, a mattress and some bedding. The mattresses would be spread upon the floor in rows&mdash;and there would be nothing else in the place except a stove.

Very frequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double shifts of men.</p><p>Mrs. Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face.</p></div> </div>
