Now, however, when he saw him, alive and in the flesh, the same thing happened to him that had happened before&mdash;a flood of rage boiled up in him, a blind frenzy seized him. And he flung himself at the man, and smote him between the eyes&mdash;and then, as he fell, seized him by the throat and began to pound his head upon the stones.</p><p>The woman began screaming, and people came rushing in. The lantern had been upset and extinguished, and it was so dark they could not see a thing; but they could hear Jurgis panting, and hear the thumping of his victim's skull, and they rushed there and tried to pull him off.</p></div> </div>
