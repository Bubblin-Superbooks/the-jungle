<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Just about this time one of the Chicago newspapers, which made much of the &ldquo;common people,&rdquo; opened a &ldquo;free-soup kitchen&rdquo; for the benefit of the unemployed. Some people said that they did this for the sake of the advertising it gave them, and some others said that their motive was a fear lest all their readers should be starved off; but whatever the reason, the soup was thick and hot, and there was a bowl for every man, all night long. When Jurgis heard of this, from a fellow &ldquo;hobo,&rdquo; he vowed that he would have half a dozen bowls before morning; but, as it proved, he was lucky to get one, for there was a line of men two blocks long before the stand, and there was just as long a line when the place was finally closed up.</p></div> </div>
