<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Promptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work. He came to the door that had been pointed out to him, and there he waited for nearly two hours. The boss had meant for him to enter, but had not said this, and so it was only when on his way out to hire another man that he came upon Jurgis. He gave him a good cursing, but as Jurgis did not understand a word of it he did not object. He followed the boss, who showed him where to put his street clothes, and waited while he donned the working clothes he had bought in a secondhand shop and brought with him in a bundle; then he led him to the &ldquo;killing beds.&rdquo; The work which Jurgis was to do here was very simple, and it took him but a few minutes to learn it.</p></div> </div>
