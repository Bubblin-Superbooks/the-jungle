<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jurgis spent half an hour walking and debating the problem. There was no one he could go to for help&mdash;he had to manage it all alone. To get it changed in a lodging-house would be to take his life in his hands&mdash;he would almost certainly be robbed, and perhaps murdered, before morning. He might go to some hotel or railroad depot and ask to have it changed; but what would they think, seeing a &ldquo;bum&rdquo; like him with a hundred dollars? He would probably be arrested if he tried it; and what story could he tell? On the morrow Freddie Jones would discover his loss, and there would be a hunt for him, and he would lose his money. The only other plan he could think of was to try in a saloon. He might pay them to change it, if it could not be done otherwise.</p></div> </div>
