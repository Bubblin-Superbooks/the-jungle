<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to go and see Marija. She came down into the basement of the house to meet him, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, &ldquo;I've got work now, and so you can leave here.&rdquo;</p><p>But Marija only shook her head. There was nothing else for her to do, she said, and nobody to employ her. She could not keep her past a secret&mdash;girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were thousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would meet one of them. &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; Marija added, &ldquo;I can't do anything. I'm no good&mdash;I take dope. What could you do with me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
