<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the party of the first part hereby covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second part!&rdquo; And then again&mdash;&ldquo;a monthly rental of twelve dollars, for a period of eight years and four months!&rdquo; Then Szedvilas took off his spectacles, and looked at the agent, and stammered a question.</p><p>The agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual formula; that it was always arranged that the property should be merely rented. He kept trying to show them something in the next paragraph; but Szedvilas could not get by the word &ldquo;rental&rdquo;&mdash;and when he translated it to Teta Elzbieta, she too was thrown into a fright. They would not own the home at all, then, for nearly nine years! The agent, with infinite patience, began to explain again; but no explanation would do now.</p></div> </div>
