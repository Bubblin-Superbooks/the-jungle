<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tamoszius Kuszleika is his name, and he has taught himself to play the violin by practicing all night, after working all day on the &ldquo;killing beds.&rdquo; He is in his shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold horseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy. A pair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to give that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band. He is only about five feet high, but even so these trousers are about eight inches short of the ground. You wonder where he can have gotten them or rather you would wonder, if the excitement of being in his presence left you time to think of such things.</p></div> </div>
