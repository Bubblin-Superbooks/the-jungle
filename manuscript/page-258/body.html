<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Pleasure Palaces&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wonderlands&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dream Castles&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love's Delights.&rdquo; Whatever else they were called, they were sure to be called &ldquo;Union Headquarters,&rdquo; and to hold out a welcome to workingmen; and there was always a warm stove, and a chair near it, and some friends to laugh and talk with. There was only one condition attached,&mdash;you must drink. If you went in not intending to drink, you would be put out in no time, and if you were slow about going, like as not you would get your head split open with a beer bottle in the bargain. But all of the men understood the convention and drank; they believed that by it they were getting something for nothing&mdash;for they did not need to take more than one drink, and upon the strength of it they might fill themselves up with a good hot dinner.</p></div> </div>
