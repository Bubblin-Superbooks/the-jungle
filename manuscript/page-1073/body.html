That dreadful night when he lay in the Garden of Gethsemane and writhed in agony until he sweat blood&mdash;do you think that he saw anything worse than he might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria, where men march out with a jeweled image of him before them, to do wholesale murder for the benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and cruelty? Do you not know that if he were in St. Petersburg now, he would take the whip with which he drove out the bankers from his temple&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
