<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Once upon a time old Lafferty had been caught with a gang that had stolen cows from several of the poor people of the neighborhood and butchered them in an old shanty back of the yards and sold them. He had been in jail only three days for it, and had come out laughing, and had not even lost his place in the packing house. He had gone all to ruin with the drink, however, and lost his power; one of his sons, who was a good man, had kept him and the family up for a year or two, but then he had got sick with consumption.</p><p>That was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted herself&mdash;this house was unlucky. Every family that lived in it, some one was sure to get consumption.</p></div> </div>
