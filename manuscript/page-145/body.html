<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For fear that the significance of all this should be lost, there was a label, in Polish, Lithuanian, and German&mdash;&ldquo;Dom. Namai. Heim.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why pay rent?&rdquo; the linguistic circular went on to demand. &ldquo;Why not own your own home? Do you know that you can buy one for less than your rent? We have built thousands of homes which are now occupied by happy families.&rdquo;&mdash;So it became eloquent, picturing the blissfulness of married life in a house with nothing to pay. It even quoted &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rdquo; and made bold to translate it into Polish&mdash;though for some reason it omitted the Lithuanian of this. Perhaps the translator found it a difficult matter to be sentimental in a language in which a sob is known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a nusiszypsojimas.</p></div> </div>
