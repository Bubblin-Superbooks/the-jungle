<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If we employ an arbitrary symbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then the cost of a bushel of wheat is fifty cents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You say 'for farm work,'&rdquo; said Mr. Maynard. &ldquo;Then labor is not to be paid alike?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should have millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners. Of course the wages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will have to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of workers is needed in any particular industry. That is precisely what is done at present, except that the transfer of the workers is accomplished blindly and imperfectly, by rumors and advertisements, instead of instantly and completely, by a universal government bulletin.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
