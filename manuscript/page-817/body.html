<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jurgis attended and got half insane with drink, and began quarreling over a girl; his arm was pretty strong by then, and he set to work to clean out the place, and ended in a cell in the police station. The police station being crowded to the doors, and stinking with &ldquo;bums,&rdquo; Jurgis did not relish staying there to sleep off his liquor, and sent for Halloran, who called up the district leader and had Jurgis bailed out by telephone at four o'clock in the morning. When he was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had already seen the clerk of the court and explained that Jurgis Rudkus was a decent fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so Jurgis was fined ten dollars and the fine was &ldquo;suspended&rdquo;&mdash;which meant that he did not have to pay for it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody chose to bring it up against him in the future.</p></div> </div>
