It was past and over, and he was done with it&mdash;he would fling it off his shoulders, be free of it, the whole business, that night. It should go like a black, hateful nightmare, and in the morning he would be a new man. And every time that a thought of it assailed him&mdash;a tender memory, a trace of a tear&mdash;he rose up, cursing with rage, and pounded it down.</p><p>He was fighting for his life; he gnashed his teeth together in his desperation. He had been a fool, a fool! He had wasted his life, he had wrecked himself, with his accursed weakness; and now he was done with it&mdash;he would tear it out of him, root and branch! There should be no more tears and no more tenderness;</p></div> </div>
