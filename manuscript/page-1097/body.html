<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To picture the harvest fields of the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a summer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to each place! And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system of independent small farming,&mdash;a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated with a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o'clock in the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they are able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut out from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and invention, and all the joys of the spirit&mdash;held to a bare existence by competition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too blind to see his chains!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
