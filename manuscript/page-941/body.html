The poor little fellow, with his frostbitten fingers and his terror of the snow&mdash;his wailing voice rang in Jurgis's ears, as he lay there in the darkness, until the sweat started on his forehead. Now and then he would quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little Stanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his life with the rats!</p><p>All these emotions had become strangers to the soul of Jurgis; it was so long since they had troubled him that he had ceased to think they might ever trouble him again. Helpless, trapped, as he was, what good did they do him&mdash;why should he ever have allowed them to torment him? It had been the task of his recent life to fight them down, to crush them out of him;</p></div> </div>
