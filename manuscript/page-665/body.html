Jurgis came home and covered himself with blankets to keep warm, and divided his time between sleeping and playing with little Antanas. Juozapas was away raking in the dump a good part of the time, and Elzbieta and Marija were hunting for more work.</p><p>Antanas was now over a year and a half old, and was a perfect talking machine. He learned so fast that every week when Jurgis came home it seemed to him as if he had a new child. He would sit down and listen and stare at him, and give vent to delighted exclamations&mdash;&ldquo;Palauk! Muma! Tu mano szirdele!&rdquo; The little fellow was now really the one delight that Jurgis had in the world&mdash;his one hope, his one victory.</p></div> </div>
