It was a thing scarcely to be spoken&mdash;a thing never spoken by all the world, that will not know its own defeat.</p><p>They were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside.

They had dreamed of freedom; of a chance to look about them and learn something; to be decent and clean, to see their child grow up to be strong.</p></div> </div>
