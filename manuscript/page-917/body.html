But now, at the mere mention of them, his whole being cried out with joy. He wanted to see them; he wanted to go home! They would help him&mdash;they would be kind to him. In a flash he had thought over the situation. He had a good excuse for running away&mdash;his grief at the death of his son; and also he had a good excuse for not returning&mdash;the fact that they had left Packingtown. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
