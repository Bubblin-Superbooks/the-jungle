<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ona, too, was falling into a habit of silence&mdash;Ona, who had once gone about singing like a bird. She was sick and miserable, and often she would barely have strength enough to drag herself home. And there they would eat what they had to eat, and afterward, because there was only their misery to talk of, they would crawl into bed and fall into a stupor and never stir until it was time to get up again, and dress by candlelight, and go back to the machines. They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much from hunger, now; only the children continued to fret when the food ran short.</p><p>Yet the soul of Ona was not dead&mdash;the souls of none of them were dead, but only sleeping; and now and then they would waken, and these were cruel times.</p></div> </div>
