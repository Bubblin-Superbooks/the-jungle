Jurgis blamed the bosses for this, though the truth to be told it was not always their fault; for the packers kept them frightened for their lives&mdash;and when one was in danger of falling behind the standard, what was easier than to catch up by making the gang work awhile &ldquo;for the church&rdquo;? This was a savage witticism the men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to him.</p></div> </div>
