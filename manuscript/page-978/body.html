<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There are a hundred thousand old people, cast off and helpless, waiting for death to take them from their torments! There are a million people, men and women and children, who share the curse of the wage-slave; who toil every hour they can stand and see, for just enough to keep them alive; who are condemned till the end of their days to monotony and weariness, to hunger and misery, to heat and cold, to dirt and disease, to ignorance and drunkenness and vice! And then turn over the page with me, and gaze upon the other side of the picture. There are a thousand&mdash;ten thousand, maybe&mdash;who are the masters of these slaves, who own their toil. They do nothing to earn what they receive, they do not even have to ask for it&mdash;it comes to them of itself, their only care is to dispose of it.</p></div> </div>
