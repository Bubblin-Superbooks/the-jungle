<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family that had died. That was after they had been there nearly four years, and this woman had had twins regularly every year&mdash;and there had been more than you could count when they moved in. After she died the man would go to work all day and leave them to shift for themselves&mdash;the neighbors would help them now and then, for they would almost freeze to death. At the end there were three days that they were alone, before it was found out that the father was dead. He was a &ldquo;floorsman&rdquo; at Jones's, and a wounded steer had broken loose and mashed him against a pillar. Then the children had been taken away, and the company had sold the house that very same week to a party of emigrants.</p></div> </div>
