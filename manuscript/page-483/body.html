<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To Jurgis this man's whole presence reeked of the crime he had committed; the touch of his body was madness to him&mdash;it set every nerve of him a-tremble, it aroused all the demon in his soul. It had worked its will upon Ona, this great beast&mdash;and now he had it, he had it! It was his turn now! Things swam blood before him, and he screamed aloud in his fury, lifting his victim and smashing his head upon the floor.</p><p>The place, of course, was in an uproar; women fainting and shrieking, and men rushing in. Jurgis was so bent upon his task that he knew nothing of this, and scarcely realized that people were trying to interfere with him; it was only when half a dozen men had seized him by the legs and shoulders and were pulling at him, that he understood that he was losing his prey.</p></div> </div>
