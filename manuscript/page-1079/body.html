<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> After the revolution, all the intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be cared for by such &ldquo;free associations&rdquo;; romantic novelists would be supported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist painters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist pictures&mdash;and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors and musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could find no one to maintain him, he could support himself by working part of the time. That was the case at present, the only difference being that the competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to live, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any one would be able to support himself by an hour's work a day.</p></div> </div>
