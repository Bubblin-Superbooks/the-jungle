<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tommy Hinds had begun life as a blacksmith's helper, and had run away to join the Union army, where he had made his first acquaintance with &ldquo;graft,&rdquo; in the shape of rotten muskets and shoddy blankets. To a musket that broke in a crisis he always attributed the death of his only brother, and upon worthless blankets he blamed all the agonies of his own old age. Whenever it rained, the rheumatism would get into his joints, and then he would screw up his face and mutter: &ldquo;Capitalism, my boy, capitalism! 'Ecrasez l'infame!'&rdquo; He had one unfailing remedy for all the evils of this world, and he preached it to every one; no matter whether the person's trouble was failure in business, or dyspepsia, or a quarrelsome mother-in-law, a twinkle would come into his eyes and he would say, &ldquo;You know what to do about it&mdash;vote the Socialist ticket!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
