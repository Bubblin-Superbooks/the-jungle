<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Horse racing had once been a sport, but nowadays it was a business; a horse could be &ldquo;doped&rdquo; and doctored, undertrained or overtrained; it could be made to fall at any moment&mdash;or its gait could be broken by lashing it with the whip, which all the spectators would take to be a desperate effort to keep it in the lead. There were scores of such tricks; and sometimes it was the owners who played them and made fortunes, sometimes it was the jockeys and trainers, sometimes it was outsiders, who bribed them&mdash;but most of the time it was the chiefs of the trust. Now for instance, they were having winter racing in New Orleans and a syndicate was laying out each day's program in advance, and its agents in all the Northern cities were &ldquo;milking&rdquo; the poolrooms.</p></div> </div>
