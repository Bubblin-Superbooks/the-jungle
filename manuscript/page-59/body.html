<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As time goes on there is a variety of drunkenness, among the younger men especially. Some stagger about in each other's arms, whispering maudlin words&mdash;others start quarrels upon the slightest pretext, and come to blows and have to be pulled apart.

The thing to do is to crack every fighting head that you see, before there are so many fighting heads that you cannot crack any of them. There is but scant account kept of cracked heads in back of the yards, for men who have to crack the heads of animals all day seem to get into the habit, and to practice on their friends, and even on their families, between times.</p></div> </div>
