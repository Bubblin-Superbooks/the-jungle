Jurgis turned white, and so weak at the knees that he could hardly leave his cell.</p><p>The man led him down the corridor and a flight of steps to the visitors' room, which was barred like a cell. Through the grating Jurgis could see some one sitting in a chair; and as he came into the room the person started up, and he saw that it was little Stanislovas. At the sight of some one from home the big fellow nearly went to pieces&mdash;he had to steady himself by a chair, and he put his other hand to his forehead, as if to clear away a mist. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, weakly.</p></div> </div>
