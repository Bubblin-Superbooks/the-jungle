Grief, despair, rage, overwhelmed him&mdash;what was any imagination of the thing to this heartbreaking, crushing reality of it&mdash;to the sight of strange people living in his house, hanging their curtains to his windows, staring at him with hostile eyes! It was monstrous, it was unthinkable&mdash;they could not do it&mdash;it could not be true! Only think what he had suffered for that house&mdash;what miseries they had all suffered for it&mdash;the price they had paid for it!</p><p>The whole long agony came back to him. Their sacrifices in the beginning, their three hundred dollars that they had scraped together, all they owned in the world, all that stood between them and starvation! And then their toil, month by month, to get together the twelve dollars, and the interest as well, and now and then the taxes, and the other charges, and the repairs, and what not!</p></div> </div>
