<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The farmer tills the soil, the miner digs in the earth, the weaver tends the loom, the mason carves the stone; the clever man invents, the shrewd man directs, the wise man studies, the inspired man sings&mdash;and all the result, the products of the labor of brain and muscle, are gathered into one stupendous stream and poured into their laps! The whole of society is in their grip, the whole labor of the world lies at their mercy&mdash;and like fierce wolves they rend and destroy, like ravening vultures they devour and tear! The whole power of mankind belongs to them, forever and beyond recall&mdash;do what it can, strive as it will, humanity lives for them and dies for them! They own not merely the labor of society, they have bought the governments;</p></div> </div>
