<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And so on Christmas Eve Jurgis worked till nearly one o'clock in the morning, and on Christmas Day he was on the killing bed at seven o'clock.</p><p>All this was bad; and yet it was not the worst. For after all the hard work a man did, he was paid for only part of it. Jurgis had once been among those who scoffed at the idea of these huge concerns cheating; and so now he could appreciate the bitter irony of the fact that it was precisely their size which enabled them to do it with impunity. One of the rules on the killing beds was that a man who was one minute late was docked an hour; and this was economical, for he was made to work the balance of the hour&mdash;he was not allowed to stand round and wait. And on the other hand if he came ahead of time he got no pay for that&mdash;though often the bosses would start up the gang ten or fifteen minutes before the whistle.</p></div> </div>
