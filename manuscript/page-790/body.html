Youse had better call the wagon, Billy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;He's got no more fight in him, I guess&mdash;and he's only got a block to go.&rdquo; He twisted his hand in Jurgis's collar and jerked at him. &ldquo;Git up here, you!&rdquo; he commanded.</p><p>But Jurgis did not move, and the bartender went behind the bar, and after stowing the hundred-dollar bill away in a safe hiding place, came and poured a glass of water over Jurgis. Then, as the latter began to moan feebly, the policeman got him to his feet and dragged him out of the place. The station house was just around the corner, and so in a few minutes Jurgis was in a cell.</p></div> </div>
