<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>there will be some one man whom pain and suffering have made desperate, whom some chance vision of wrong and horror has startled and shocked into attention. And to him my words will come like a sudden flash of lightning to one who travels in darkness&mdash;revealing the way before him, the perils and the obstacles&mdash;solving all problems, making all difficulties clear! The scales will fall from his eyes, the shackles will be torn from his limbs&mdash;he will leap up with a cry of thankfulness, he will stride forth a free man at last! A man delivered from his self-created slavery! A man who will never more be trapped&mdash;whom no blandishments will cajole, whom no threats will frighten; who from tonight on will move forward, and not backward, who will study and understand, who will gird on his sword and take his place in the army of his comrades and brothers.</p></div> </div>
