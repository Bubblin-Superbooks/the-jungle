<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nineteen hundred years that his words have been preached as divine, and here two armies of men are rending and tearing each other like the wild beasts of the forest! Philosophers have reasoned, prophets have denounced, poets have wept and pleaded&mdash;and still this hideous Monster roams at large! We have schools and colleges, newspapers and books; we have searched the heavens and the earth, we have weighed and probed and reasoned&mdash;and all to equip men to destroy each other! We call it War, and pass it by&mdash;but do not put me off with platitudes and conventions&mdash;come with me, come with me&mdash;realize it! See the bodies of men pierced by bullets, blown into pieces by bursting shells! Hear the crunching of the bayonet, plunged into human flesh;</p></div> </div>
