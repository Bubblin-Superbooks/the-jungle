<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Stanislovas unable to get to work for the snow, the whole family turned out on the street. God Almighty! would they actually let them lie down in the street and die? Would there be no help even then&mdash;would they wander about in the snow till they froze? Jurgis had never seen any dead bodies in the streets, but he had seen people evicted and disappear, no one knew where; and though the city had a relief bureau, though there was a charity organization society in the stockyards district, in all his life there he had never heard of either of them. They did not advertise their activities, having more calls than they could attend to without that.</p><p>&mdash;So on until morning. Then he had another ride in the patrol wagon, along with the drunken wife-beater and the maniac, several &ldquo;plain drunks&rdquo; and &ldquo;saloon fighters,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
