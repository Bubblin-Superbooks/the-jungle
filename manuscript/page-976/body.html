Put your hand upon that piece of flesh&mdash;it is hot and quivering&mdash;just now it was a part of a man! This blood is still steaming&mdash;it was driven by a human heart! Almighty God! and this goes on&mdash;it is systematic, organized, premeditated! And we know it, and read of it, and take it for granted; our papers tell of it, and the presses are not stopped&mdash;our churches know of it, and do not close their doors&mdash;the people behold it, and do not rise up in horror and revolution!</p><p>&ldquo;Or perhaps Manchuria is too far away for you&mdash;come home with me then, come here to Chicago.</p></div> </div>
