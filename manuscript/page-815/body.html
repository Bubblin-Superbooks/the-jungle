<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jurgis expressed himself as agreeable, and the other took him that afternoon (it was Saturday) to a place where city laborers were being paid off. The paymaster sat in a little booth, with a pile of envelopes before him, and two policemen standing by. Jurgis went, according to directions, and gave the name of &ldquo;Michael O'Flaherty,&rdquo; and received an envelope, which he took around the corner and delivered to Halloran, who was waiting for him in a saloon. Then he went again; and gave the name of &ldquo;Johann Schmidt,&rdquo; and a third time, and give the name of &ldquo;Serge Reminitsky.&rdquo; Halloran had quite a list of imaginary workingmen, and Jurgis got an envelope for each one. For this work he received five dollars, and was told that he might have it every week, so long as he kept quiet.</p></div> </div>
