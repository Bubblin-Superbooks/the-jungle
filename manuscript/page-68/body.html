<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jurgis talked lightly about work, because he was young. They told him stories about the breaking down of men, there in the stockyards of Chicago, and of what had happened to them afterward&mdash;stories to make your flesh creep, but Jurgis would only laugh. He had only been there four months, and he was young, and a giant besides. There was too much health in him. He could not even imagine how it would feel to be beaten. &ldquo;That is well enough for men like you,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;silpnas, puny fellows&mdash;but my back is broad.&rdquo;</p><p>Jurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country. He was the sort of man the bosses like to get hold of, the sort they make it a grievance they cannot get hold of. When he was told to go to a certain place, he would go there on the run.</p></div> </div>
