After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade&mdash;there was only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such schemes&mdash;they had what they called &ldquo;boneless hams,&rdquo; which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and &ldquo;California hams,&rdquo; which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy &ldquo;skinned hams,&rdquo; which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them&mdash;that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled &ldquo;head cheese!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
