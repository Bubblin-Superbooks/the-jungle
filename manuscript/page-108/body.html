The chutes into which the hogs went climbed high up&mdash;to the very top of the distant buildings; and Jokubas explained that the hogs went up by the power of their own legs, and then their weight carried them back through all the processes necessary to make them into pork.</p><p>&ldquo;They don't waste anything here,&rdquo; said the guide, and then he laughed and added a witticism, which he was pleased that his unsophisticated friends should take to be his own: &ldquo;They use everything about the hog except the squeal.</p></div> </div>
