<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Everywhere Jurgis went he kept meeting them, and he was in an agony of fear lest some one of them should know that he was &ldquo;wanted.&rdquo; He would have left Chicago, only by the time he had realized his danger he was almost penniless; and it would be better to go to jail than to be caught out in the country in the winter time.</p><p>At the end of about ten days Jurgis had only a few pennies left; and he had not yet found a job&mdash;not even a day's work at anything, not a chance to carry a satchel. Once again, as when he had come out of the hospital, he was bound hand and foot, and facing the grisly phantom of starvation. Raw, naked terror possessed him, a maddening passion that would never leave him, and that wore him down more quickly than the actual want of food.</p></div> </div>
