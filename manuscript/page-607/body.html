He clutched her hands, he shook her, he caught her in his arms and pressed her to him but she lay cold and still&mdash;she was gone&mdash;she was gone!</p><p>The word rang through him like the sound of a bell, echoing in the far depths of him, making forgotten chords to vibrate, old shadowy fears to stir&mdash;fears of the dark, fears of the void, fears of annihilation. She was dead! She was dead! He would never see her again, never hear her again! An icy horror of loneliness seized him; he saw himself standing apart and watching all the world fade away from him&mdash;a world of shadows, of fickle dreams.</p></div> </div>
