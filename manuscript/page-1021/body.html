I've discharged him seven times now, and I've about made up my mind that's enough. Would you be a porter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It's hard work. You'll have to clean floors and wash spittoons and fill lamps and handle trunks&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm willing, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right. I'll pay you thirty a month and board, and you can begin now, if you feel like it. You can put on the other fellow's rig.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
