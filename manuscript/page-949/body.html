<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Did you notice that little French girl with the yellow hair, that stood next to me in the court?&rdquo;</p><p>Jurgis answered in the affirmative.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, she came to America about a year ago. She was a store clerk, and she hired herself to a man to be sent here to work in a factory. There were six of them, all together, and they were brought to a house just down the street from here, and this girl was put into a room alone, and they gave her some dope in her food, and when she came to she found that she had been ruined. She cried, and screamed, and tore her hair, but she had nothing but a wrapper, and couldn't get away, and they kept her half insensible with drugs all the time, until she gave up. She never got outside of that place for ten months, and then they sent her away, because she didn't suit. I guess they'll put her out of here, too&mdash;she's getting to have crazy fits, from drinking absinthe.</p></div> </div>
