What's the use of talking about it&mdash;I'll stay here till I die, I guess. It's all I'm fit for.&rdquo; And that was all that he could get her to say&mdash;there was no use trying. When he told her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered indifferently: &ldquo;Then it'll be wasted here&mdash;that's all.&rdquo; Her eyelids looked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was annoying her, that she only wanted him to go away. So he went, disappointed and sad.</p></div> </div>
