<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One could never get in advance more than a guess as to this from a saloon-keeper&mdash;and then, when the time came he always came to you scratching his head and saying that he had guessed too low, but that he had done his best&mdash;your guests had gotten so very drunk. By him you were sure to be cheated unmercifully, and that even though you thought yourself the dearest of the hundreds of friends he had. He would begin to serve your guests out of a keg that was half full, and finish with one that was half empty, and then you would be charged for two kegs of beer. He would agree to serve a certain quality at a certain price, and when the time came you and your friends would be drinking some horrible poison that could not be described. You might complain, but you would get nothing for your pains but a ruined evening; while, as for going to law about it, you might as well go to heaven at once.</p></div> </div>
