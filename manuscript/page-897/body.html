<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Poor Jurgis was now an outcast and a tramp once more. He was crippled&mdash;he was as literally crippled as any wild animal which has lost its claws, or been torn out of its shell. He had been shorn, at one cut, of all those mysterious weapons whereby he had been able to make a living easily and to escape the consequences of his actions. He could no longer command a job when he wanted it; he could no longer steal with impunity&mdash;he must take his chances with the common herd. Nay worse, he dared not mingle with the herd&mdash;he must hide himself, for he was one marked out for destruction. His old companions would betray him, for the sake of the influence they would gain thereby; and he would be made to suffer, not merely for the offense he had committed, but for others which would be laid at his door, just as had been done for some poor devil on the occasion of that assault upon the &ldquo;country customer&rdquo; by him and Duane.</p></div> </div>
