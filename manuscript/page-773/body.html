He ate as with two shovels, his fork in one hand and his knife in the other; when he once got started his wolf-hunger got the better of him, and he did not stop for breath until he had cleared every plate. &ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; said the other, who had been watching him in wonder.</p><p>Then he held Jurgis the bottle. &ldquo;Lessee you drink now,&rdquo; he said; and Jurgis took the bottle and turned it up to his mouth, and a wonderfully unearthly liquid ecstasy poured down his throat, tickling every nerve of him, thrilling him with joy.</p></div> </div>
